I am a CS Ph.D. Candidate at the University of Maryland (UMD), College Park, advised by Prof. Abhinav Bhatele in the 
Parallel Software and Systems Group. Prior to UMD, I completed my Bachelors and Masters in Computer Science and Engineering at Indian Institute of Technology, Kharagpur.


My research focuses on High Performance Computing (HPC) for AI training, where I 
explore scalable solutions to enhance the efficiency of deep learning models on supercomputers and large-scale GPU 
clusters. In AY 2023-24, I was honored to receive the Outstanding Graduate Research Assistant Award at the 
University of Maryland for my contributions to HPC and AI training.
